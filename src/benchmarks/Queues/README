Compilation
===========

This benchmark can be built with several of the queue data structures
in NBAda.

Lock-Free_Bounded_Queue

% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Bounded_Queue `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_BOUNDED LF_POOLS`


Lock-Free_Queue + EBMR / HPMR

% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Queue `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_EBMR`
% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Queue `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_HPMR`


Lock-Free_Queue_2 + LFMR / LFRC

% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Queue `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFMR`
% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Queue `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFRC`


LFMR example queue

% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILFMR `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFMR`


LFRC example queue

% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILFRC `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFRC`


Lock-Free_Deque Left + LFMR / LFRC
% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Deque_Left `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFRM`
% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Deque_Left `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFRC`


Lock-Free_Deque Right + LFMR / LFRC
% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Deque_Right `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFRM`
% gnatmake queue_test.adb  -ILock-Free_Deque_Right `nbada_config LF_QUEUES_LFRC`
