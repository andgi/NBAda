Introduction

  Hazard pointers is a lock-free memory management scheme that provides
  safe reclamation of dynamically allocated memory in a concurrent
  (lock-free) environment. This is a very tricky business since concurrent
  threads might have pointers to a shared node in private variables or
  CPU registers.

  Hazard pointers, introduced by Maged Michael in
  ["Hazard Pointers: Safe Memory Reclamation for Lock-Free Objects",
  IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,
  15(6), 491--504, June 2004] solves this problem for lock-free algorithms
  that do not require the ability to safely dereference pointers inside
  dynamically allocated nodes. Surprisingly many lock-free algorithms and
  data structures can be implemented using this scheme.

  Here I have included an example application, namely a library implementing
  lock-free Load-Linked and Store-Conditional primitives for arbitrarily
  large objects. This implementation is based on the paper
  [Maged Michael, "Practical Lock-Free and Wait-Free LL/SC/VL
   Implementations Using 64-Bit CAS", The 18th International Conference on
   Distributed Computing, October 2004].
  Curiously, despite its name, the algorithm works perfectly well also using
  32-bit Compare and Swap.

   For data-structures that require more from the memory management
   than Hazard Pointers offer I recommend a reference counter based
   approach like the one developed by me and my colleagues. (See
   [Anders Gidenstam, Marina Papatriantafilou, Håkan Sundell, Philippas
    Tsigas, "Efficient and Reliable Lock-Free Memory Reclamation Based on
    Reference Counting", Proc. of the 8th International Symposium on
    Parallel Architectures, Algorithms, and Networks (I-SPAN), pages 202 -
    207, 2005].) I have made an Ada implementation of our scheme which I
   hope I can make available for download soon.

Test program

  The very minimal test programs can be compiled with the following commands:

  On IA32: (i.e. Intel x86 architecture)
  > ./COMPILE.IA32
  > gnatmake -I../Primitives -I../Primitives/IA32 -I../Lock-Free_Storage_Pools -gnato -fstack-check -gnata -gnatv -gnatf -O stack_test

  On SPARC:
  > ./COMPILE.SPARCv8+
  > gnatmake -I../Primitives -I../Primitives/SPARCv9 -I../Lock-Free_Storage_Pools -gnato -fstack-check -gnata -gnatv -gnatf stack_test -cargs -Wa,-xarch=v8plu

  On MIPS Irix:
  > ./COMPILE.MIPSN32
  > gnatmake -I../Primitives -I../Primitives/MIPSN32 -I../Lock-Free_Storage_Pools -gnato -fstack-check -gnata -gnatv -gnatf stack_tes
