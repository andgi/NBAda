Introduction

  This is an Ada implementation of the lock-free bounded size FIFO queue
  algorithm presented by Philippas Tsigas and Yi Zhang in
  [P. Tsigas and Y. Zhang, "A Simple, Fast and Scalable Non-Blocking
   Concurrent FIFO Queue for Shared Memory Multiprocessor Systems",
   Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM symposium on Parallel algorithms and
   architectures (SPAA), 134--143, ACM, July 2001].
  The FIFO queue can be used for any data type that can be represented in
  32 bits with two unique values reserved for internal use (i.e. those
  two values must not occur as data).
 
  For more details of the algorithm see the paper, which can be found on
  Philippas Tsigas' publication page:

Test program

  The very minimal test program can be compiled with the following commands:

  On IA32: (i.e. Intel x86 architecture)
  > gnatmake -I../Primitives -I../Primitives/IA32 queue_test

  On SPARC:
  > gnatmake -I../Primitives -I../Primitives/SPARCv9 queue_test -cargs -Wa,-xarch=v8plus

  On MIPS Irix:
  > gnatmake -I../Primitives -I../Primitives/MIPSN32 queue_test
