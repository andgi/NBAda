                 requires special care. Many lock-free algorithms
                 require deleted nodes not to be reused until no active
                 pointers point to them. Also, most lock-free algorithms
                 use the compare_and_swap atomic primitive, which can
                 suffer from the ``ABA problem'' associated with memory
                 reuse. Valois ~\cite{Valois-thesis-1995} proposed a
                 memory management method for link-based data structures
                 that addresses these problems. The method associates a
                 reference count with each node of reusable memory. A
                 node is reused only when no processes or data
                 structures point to it. The method solves the ABA
                 problem for acyclic link-based data structures, and
                 allows lock-free algorithms more flexibility as nodes
                 are not required to be freed immediately after a delete
                 operation (e.g.\ dequeue, pop, delete min, etc.).
                 However, there are race conditions that may corrupt
                 data structure that use this method. In this report we
                 correct these race conditions and present a corrected
                 version of Valois's method.",
